              <li>This project was part of the senior capstone course for 2019-2020 at UT Austin. Under Dr. Emily Porter, our team designed and built an embedded system and mobile application. The embedded processor, a TI MSP432P401R, was placed on a PCB. This PCB was sewn into a glove that a user will wear. The system collects heart rate, movement, and GSR and communicates the data through bluetooth to a mobile application. The mobile application then uses a knn model to classify the user as stressed or unstressed and communicate the status to them.</li>
