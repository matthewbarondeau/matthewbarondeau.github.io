1. Matthew was rude and condescending when I came in to office hours or showed up for review sessions. There were even times where I
asked about an error in his work and he tried to humiliate me before realizing he was wrong. I would say he is the worst TA I had
this semester.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Matthew was amazing! He always helped me and never got frustrated when I would ask him the same question five times over and
over. Super smart guy!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Assignments were crazy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Was a really good TA, was very clear when explaining concepts and was very helpful when asked complex questions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Matthew was very warm and receptive to any questions I had. He explained the material in a very simple and understandable way. It
was very apparent that he enjoys teaching and helping other students. He's a great TA and I really hope he TAs EE 319K with Dr.
Yeraballi next semester, because I will be taking that class.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. TA was always available when I needed. Was effective in answering questions and going over the material taught in class. Made me
feel welcome to ask question or ask for help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. He is very passionate about EE, and is always willing to answers questions. He is very informed on all aspects of EE, and is very
capable of being a TA for any class.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Was great and interacted well with students, very helpful and nice.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. He was a very knowledgeable teacher and helped whenever anyone had trouble.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Very nice, easy to work with and was always willing to help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Great TA and a cool dude.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. I will never forget task 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. Great TA. Knew what he was saying and was always available for questions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. Good TA.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Very helpful and very good at reviewing over the material and explaining it more in depth for clarity. Was always encouraging and
helped make the class and material seem less daunting, made it more interesting and fun! Overall one of the best TA's I've had.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. Matthew was an amazing TA. He knew his stuff and allowed me to understand the material when I did not understand it. He was funny
and interesting during recitations while also being very approachable. Many times I would go to him instead of Dr. Y because he
was just so much easier to get to.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. Matthew was an excellent TA, but the tasks throughout the semester subjected students to a somewhat excessive workload.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. They were very knowledgeable about the material and could explain things clearly, but sometimes seemed to get a little impatient.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. He made this class absolutely terrible by being a smug idiot and creating tasks and projects that were seemingly impossible to
complete and required many hours of extra time that was completely unnecessary to the class. I hope he doesn't TA again.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20. Matthew was always available to help and made the class more interesting. I am currently a junior and have had many TAs and he is
one of the best TAs I've ever had.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21. You didn't have to assign Task 2, man. You just didn't. We could've learned the same concepts with a 5 state machine. Hell, a 10
state machine. Maybe even 20. But 45? That is just too much. Unbelievable. Do you think you are helping? Do you think that this
is some sort of elaborate way to make us learn? Or are you just lording over us, wasting our time. Not to mention taking our
grades and self esteem along with our time.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22. Lacked empathy for the students who had to do task 2 on top of a program and turn in home work. We had a week to finish a program
and a home work assignment which is a lot but its doable, but then the TA released a 45 state state machine for the students to
put together, in one week. This was completely unnecessary and added tremendous stress on the student body.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. Created difficult problems and regretted to explain them to us. Tasks were terrible and pointless and nobody knew what to do.
