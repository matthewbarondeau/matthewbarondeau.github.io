1. Matthew Barondeau is one of the greatest TAs on the EE 319K team. He knows the material in and out and is ready for any question
that is asked of him. He goes above and beyond in being a TA. I remember when lab 9 was plaguing the class, he came intothe lab
on any off periods he had to help. He was able to debug an insane amount of UART handlers in short periods of time. He also makes
sure to check in on his students outside of his office hours. He cares about the mental state of his students and shows that when
he checks in on many of us after difficult assessments in the class. Great TA!

2. A cool dude.  Was very helpful with material and obviously very knowledgeable.  I hope to have him as a TA again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Matthew was a great TA. Very obviously knowledgeable in all things embedded. 10/10 would put a comment for every line again.

4. Great TA

5. Matthew was super helpful in his office hours and helped in a positive way in the sense that he didn't give you the answers, but
guided you in such a way that it felt easy.

6. Most helpful TA I've ever had. Matthew is very good at what he does, whether it be teaching or embedded systems in general.

7. While the labs were not exceptionally difficult, and there was constantly TA office hours for help with them, the labs themselves
took way too long. Each week, the majority of the time that I spent on homework was on the labs, for the entire semester. With
this being said, Matthew was exceptionally helpful among the TA's, and showed not only his understanding of the subject, but
explained things in a meaningful way.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Great TA! Very knowledgeable and if I did not understand a concept he would break it down and try to relate it to something else
we had learned earlier. He also helped me feel better about the exams and labs by providing tips on how to go forward with them
and how to manage my time on the midterms.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. I have never met this TA and I don't know who he/she is. When there's 16 TA's in a class please don't make us do these
evaluations because there's a small chance that we have met most of them, and especially don't make us answer questions about the
lab because those questions are going to be the same exact thing 16 times.

10. Plz endorse my friend to be a TA :P
