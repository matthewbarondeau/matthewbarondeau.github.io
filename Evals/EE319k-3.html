1&#46; You are definitely the best TA that I have had at UT&#46; Thank you for all of the extra work you put in to make reviews and really
help teach&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2&#46; Very kind and approachable person who is receptive to any question&#46; Seem to take extra care that material was understood&#46;   Also
went above and beyond with helping for exam preparation&#46; He created multiple extra practice problems for the programmingtest&#46; The
effort in of itself is amazing&#44; and that the problems were actually challenging &#40;at least to me&#41; and thus even more useful&#44; shows
how much effort and care he puts into helping the students&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3&#46; Creative and came up with practice problems to help better prepare students&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4&#46; Never actually met him
