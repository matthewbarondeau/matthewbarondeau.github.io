1&#46; Great TA&#33; Very knowledgeable and if I did not understand a concept he would break it down and try to relate it to something else
we had learned earlier&#46; He also helped me feel better about the exams and labs by providing tips on how to go forward with them
and how to manage my time on the midterms&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2&#46; I have never met this TA and I don&#39;t know who he&#47;she is&#46; When there&#39;s 16 TA&#39;s in a class please don&#39;t make us do these
evaluations because there&#39;s a small chance that we have met most of them&#44; and especially don&#39;t make us answer questions about the
lab because those questions are going to be the same exact thing 16 times&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3&#46; Plz endorse my friend to be a TA &#58;P
