Section 1:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Thank you for going out of your way and making additional practice exams even though you didn't have to. Furthermore, thank you
for holding extra office hours during our time of need. You're a good man, thank you Matthew.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Matthew is the nicest TA in the course, and he is extremely knowledgeable and helpful with the course material.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Great TA, very approachable and friendly, but professional and helpful when necessary. Made me feel comfortable about asking
questions, and was very thorough in the answers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Matthew was so nice and so so helpful. He was very good at explaining concepts in a clear and concise way that was easy for
students to understand. Overall a really wonderful TA.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Mathew was very kind and knowledgeable I would rate him as one of the best 319K TAs
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Matthew really went out of his way to help the students, and in particular he scheduled extra office hours and extra lab
checkouts to give the students more time for their projects. He willingly sacrificed his time for us, and I really hope this
doesn't go unnoticed. Go Matthew! Thanks for everything!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. You are definitely the best TA that I have had at UT. Thank you for all of the extra work you put in to make reviews and really
help teach.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Very kind and approachable person who is receptive to any question. Seem to take extra care that material was understood.   Also
went above and beyond with helping for exam preparation. He created multiple extra practice problems for the programmingtest. The
effort in of itself is amazing, and that the problems were actually challenging (at least to me) and thus even more useful, shows
how much effort and care he puts into helping the students.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. Creative and came up with practice problems to help better prepare students.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10. Never actually met him
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11. Matthew is SO funny. He knows his stuff and is incredibly friendly. Only downside is short OH.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12. Matthew is one of the greatest TAs, he puts in more effort than he has to and really cares about the students and the class. I
always felt comfortable going to him and bugging him about the smallest questions and he always gave great advice on how to
prepare. He is definitely my go-to TA and I honestly feel like I would not have performed as well in this class if he wasn't
available or helpful. He went above and beyond and Spring 2018 is lucky to have had him as a TA.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13. You have been such a great TA! The review session before the first test was immensly helpful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14. I like how you seem so motivated to help us learn.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. Great instructor! Very helpful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. During lab, if I ever didn't know the answer to a question, Matthew would help me out. He was very generous when it came to
grading, but he made sure that my lab partner and I grasped the concept of each week's lab.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17. I didn't really have Matthew as my TA, but when I did he was very helpful!
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18. great TA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19. Matthew's office hours were where I went when I was extremely confused on that week's lab. There, everything clicked. When
everything about the lab seemed overwhelming, Matthew managed to break it up into it's simple form. I asked him questions not
only about EE319K, but also some questions about EE302 at times, and he was happy to explain certain concepts from that class as
well that I did not fully understand last semester. Matthew was not only extremely knowledgable about the material, but of all
the TA's I have had during my first year at UT, Matthew was perhaps the most patient and kind, and I would love to have him as a
TA for future classes. So, Matthew, thank you for everything.
