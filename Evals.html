    <p> Matthew was very warm and receptive to any questions I had. He explained the material in a very simple and understandable way. It
        was very apparent that he enjoys teaching and helping other students. He's a great TA and I really hope he TAs EE 319K with Dr.
        Yeraballi next semester, because I will be taking that class.</p>
    
    <p> Matthew was an amazing TA. He knew his stuff and allowed me to understand the material when I did not understand it. He was funny
        and interesting during recitations while also being very approachable. Many times I would go to him instead of Dr. Y because he
        was just so much easier to get to.</p>

    <p> Very kind and approachable person who is receptive to any question. Seem to take extra care that material was understood.   Also
        went above and beyond with helping for exam preparation. He created multiple extra practice problems for the programmingtest. The
        effort in of itself is amazing, and that the problems were actually challenging (at least to me) and thus even more useful, shows
        how much effort and care he puts into helping the students. </p>
    <p> Matthew's office hours were where I went when I was extremely confused on that week's lab. There, everything clicked. When
        everything about the lab seemed overwhelming, Matthew managed to break it up into it's simple form. I asked him questions not
        only about EE319K, but also some questions about EE302 at times, and he was happy to explain certain concepts from that class as
        well that I did not fully understand last semester. Matthew was not only extremely knowledgable about the material, but of all
        the TA's I have had during my first year at UT, Matthew was perhaps the most patient and kind, and I would love to have him as a
        TA for future classes. So, Matthew, thank you for everything. </p>
    <p> Never actually met him </p>

    <p> Matthew Barondeau is one of the greatest TAs on the EE 319K team. He knows the material in and out and is ready for any question
        that is asked of him. He goes above and beyond in being a TA. I remember when lab 9 was plaguing the class, he came intothe lab
        on any off periods he had to help. He was able to debug an insane amount of UART handlers in short periods of time. He also makes
        sure to check in on his students outside of his office hours. He cares about the mental state of his students and shows that when
        he checks in on many of us after difficult assessments in the class. Great TA!</p>
    <p> Great TA! Very knowledgeable and if I did not understand a concept he would break it down and try to relate it to something else
        we had learned earlier. He also helped me feel better about the exams and labs by providing tips on how to go forward with them
        and how to manage my time on the midterms.</p>
