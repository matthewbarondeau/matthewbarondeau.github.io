1&#46; Matthew Barondeau is one of the greatest TAs on the EE 319K team&#46; He knows the material in and out and is ready for any question
that is asked of him&#46; He goes above and beyond in being a TA&#46; I remember when lab 9 was plaguing the class&#44; he came intothe lab
on any off periods he had to help&#46; He was able to debug an insane amount of UART handlers in short periods of time&#46; He also makes
sure to check in on his students outside of his office hours&#46; He cares about the mental state of his students and shows that when
he checks in on many of us after difficult assessments in the class&#46; Great TA&#33;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2&#46; A cool dude&#46;  Was very helpful with material and obviously very knowledgeable&#46;  I hope to have him as a TA again
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3&#46; Matthew was a great TA&#46; Very obviously knowledgeable in all things embedded&#46; 10&#47;10 would put a comment for every line again&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4&#46; Great TA
