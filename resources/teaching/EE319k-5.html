1&#46; Great instructor&#33; Very helpful&#33;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2&#46; During lab&#44; if I ever didn&#39;t know the answer to a question&#44; Matthew would help me out&#46; He was very generous when it came to
grading&#44; but he made sure that my lab partner and I grasped the concept of each week&#39;s lab&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3&#46; I didn&#39;t really have Matthew as my TA&#44; but when I did he was very helpful&#33;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4&#46; great TA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5&#46; Matthew&#39;s office hours were where I went when I was extremely confused on that week&#39;s lab&#46; There&#44; everything clicked&#46; When
everything about the lab seemed overwhelming&#44; Matthew managed to break it up into it&#39;s simple form&#46; I asked him questions not
only about EE319K&#44; but also some questions about EE302 at times&#44; and he was happy to explain certain concepts from that class as
well that I did not fully understand last semester&#46; Matthew was not only extremely knowledgable about the material&#44; but of all
the TA&#39;s I have had during my first year at UT&#44; Matthew was perhaps the most patient and kind&#44; and I would love to have him as a
TA for future classes&#46; So&#44; Matthew&#44; thank you for everything&#46;
