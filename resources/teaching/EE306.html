1&#46; Matthew was rude and condescending when I came in to office hours or showed up for review sessions&#46; There were even times where I
asked about an error in his work and he tried to humiliate me before realizing he was wrong&#46; I would say he is the worst TA I had
this semester&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2&#46; Matthew was amazing&#33; He always helped me and never got frustrated when I would ask him the same question five times over and
over&#46; Super smart guy&#33;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3&#46; Assignments were crazy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4&#46; Was a really good TA&#44; was very clear when explaining concepts and was very helpful when asked complex questions&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5&#46; Matthew was very warm and receptive to any questions I had&#46; He explained the material in a very simple and understandable way&#46; It
was very apparent that he enjoys teaching and helping other students&#46; He&#39;s a great TA and I really hope he TAs EE 319K with Dr&#46;
Yeraballi next semester&#44; because I will be taking that class&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6&#46; TA was always available when I needed&#46; Was effective in answering questions and going over the material taught in class&#46; Made me
feel welcome to ask question or ask for help&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7&#46; He is very passionate about EE&#44; and is always willing to answers questions&#46; He is very informed on all aspects of EE&#44; and is very
capable of being a TA for any class&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8&#46; Was great and interacted well with students&#44; very helpful and nice&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9&#46; He was a very knowledgeable teacher and helped whenever anyone had trouble&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10&#46; Very nice&#44; easy to work with and was always willing to help
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11&#46; Great TA and a cool dude&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12&#46; I will never forget task 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13&#46; Great TA&#46; Knew what he was saying and was always available for questions&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14&#46; Good TA&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15&#46; Very helpful and very good at reviewing over the material and explaining it more in depth for clarity&#46; Was always encouraging and
helped make the class and material seem less daunting&#44; made it more interesting and fun&#33; Overall one of the best TA&#39;s I&#39;ve had&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
16&#46; Matthew was an amazing TA&#46; He knew his stuff and allowed me to understand the material when I did not understand it&#46; He was funny
and interesting during recitations while also being very approachable&#46; Many times I would go to him instead of Dr&#46; Y because he
was just so much easier to get to&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
17&#46; Matthew was an excellent TA&#44; but the tasks throughout the semester subjected students to a somewhat excessive workload&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18&#46; They were very knowledgeable about the material and could explain things clearly&#44; but sometimes seemed to get a little impatient&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
19&#46; He made this class absolutely terrible by being a smug idiot and creating tasks and projects that were seemingly impossible to
complete and required many hours of extra time that was completely unnecessary to the class&#46; I hope he doesn&#39;t TA again&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
20&#46; Matthew was always available to help and made the class more interesting&#46; I am currently a junior and have had many TAs and he is
one of the best TAs I&#39;ve ever had&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
21&#46; You didn&#39;t have to assign Task 2&#44; man&#46; You just didn&#39;t&#46; We could&#39;ve learned the same concepts with a 5 state machine&#46; Hell&#44; a 10
state machine&#46; Maybe even 20&#46; But 45&#63; That is just too much&#46; Unbelievable&#46; Do you think you are helping&#63; Do you think that this
is some sort of elaborate way to make us learn&#63; Or are you just lording over us&#44; wasting our time&#46; Not to mention taking our
grades and self esteem along with our time&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
22&#46; Lacked empathy for the students who had to do task 2 on top of a program and turn in home work&#46; We had a week to finish a program
and a home work assignment which is a lot but its doable&#44; but then the TA released a 45 state state machine for the students to
put together&#44; in one week&#46; This was completely unnecessary and added tremendous stress on the student body&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23&#46; Created difficult problems and regretted to explain them to us&#46; Tasks were terrible and pointless and nobody knew what to do&#46;
