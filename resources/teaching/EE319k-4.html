1&#46; Matthew is SO funny&#46; He knows his stuff and is incredibly friendly&#46; Only downside is short OH&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2&#46; Matthew is one of the greatest TAs&#44; he puts in more effort than he has to and really cares about the students and the class&#46; I
always felt comfortable going to him and bugging him about the smallest questions and he always gave great advice on how to
prepare&#46; He is definitely my go&#45;to TA and I honestly feel like I would not have performed as well in this class if he wasn&#39;t
available or helpful&#46; He went above and beyond and Spring 2018 is lucky to have had him as a TA&#46;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3&#46; You have been such a great TA&#33; The review session before the first test was immensly helpful&#33;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4&#46; I like how you seem so motivated to help us learn&#46;
