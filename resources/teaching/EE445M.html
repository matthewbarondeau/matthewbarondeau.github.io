2&#46; RESPONSE&#58; Matthew is a great TA&#46; He makes checkout a lot less anxiety ridden than other classes&#46; He takes our fumbling over
questions we might not know and turns it into a teaching moment&#46; The things he mentioned in the check out during these teaching
times came in clutch throughout the semester&#46; The transition from in person to online was also very smooth&#46; &#47;&#47;&#47; SURVEY SUMMARY

5&#46; RESPONSE&#58; I have had this TA my entire time at UT &#40;4 semesters&#41; and he has never failed to be extremely knowledgable about the
courese material and able to help with any and all questions I come to him with&#46; He takes the time to make sure I understand the
material and labs and cares about helping every student succeed in the class&#46; Even with moving to online classes I found his
office hours useful in better understanding the course material&#46; &#47;&#47;&#47; SURVEY SUMMARY &#40;Question Number&#45;Scale Position&#41; &#47;&#47;&#47; Q1&#45;5&#44;

7&#46; RESPONSE&#58; Matthew has consistently helped before&#44; during&#44; and after office hours&#44; and he genuinely cares about his students
learning the most they can from material&#46; He identifies loopholes in what students know and asks follow&#45;up questions to gauge
where they are at in their understanding to fill in knowledge gaps&#46; This has really helped for me&#44; since I can be hesitant to ask
questions&#46; It helps to have a TA who can tell whether I am unsure of something&#44; and he is very aware when students struggle to
understand a concept&#44; so he does his best to explain material&#46; For both halves of the semester&#44; he has done a truly outstanding
job as a TA&#46; &#47;&#47;&#47; SURVEY SUMMARY &#40;Question Number&#45;Scale Position&#41; &#47;&#47;&#47; Q1&#45;5&#44; Q2&#45;5&#44; Q3&#45;5&#44; Q4&#45;5&#44; Q5&#45;5&#44; Q6&#45;5&#44; Q7&#45;5&#44; Q8&#45;5&#44; Q9&#45;5&#44;
