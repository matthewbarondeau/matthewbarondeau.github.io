                <p>I'm a fifth year Electrical and Computing Engineering Ph.D. candidate working under Dr. Andreas Gerstlauer in the SLAM Lab at UT Austin. In my research, I have investigated efficient multithreading architectures for near-memory architecturetes, proactive ML-based heterogeneous runtime improvements, and multithreading improvements for cloud run-to-completion workloads. I also have an interest in resiliency especially for ML and neuromorphic applications that was developed by an internship at Nvidia. In my 'copious' free time, I am fascinated by issue stage microarchitecture, compiler optimizations for improving backend resource utilization in Out-of-Order processors, improving resiliency in parallel architectures, and ML-based runtime reconfiguration.</p>

                <p>Outside of research, I enjoy teaching and mentoring both undergraduate and graduate students. In the past, I have predominantly taught embedded systems courses to graduate and undergraduate students and my teaching evalutations can be found below. I have also spent significant time mentoring first-year undergraduate ECE students at UT Austin through the First-Year Intergest Group (FIG) program and have continued this work as a graduate student.</p>

                <p> When I am not at UT, I like to read science-fiction and fantasy novels where I am currently working on the Mistborn Series, Don Quixote, and The Wealth of Nations. I also enjoy being outside (though less often in Texas during the summer) where I play soccer, run, and go on hikes. I also enjoy baking and volunteering down at the Central Texas Food Bank.</p>
