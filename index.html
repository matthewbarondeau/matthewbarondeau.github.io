                <p>I'm a sixth year Electrical and Computing Engineering Ph.D. candidate working under Dr. Andreas Gerstlauer in the SLAM Lab at UT Austin. In my research, I have investigated efficient multithreading architectures for near-memory architecturetes, proactive ML-based heterogeneous runtime improvements, and resiliency for ML and neuromorphic applications. In my 'copious' free time, I am fascinated by microarchitecture, compiler optimizations for improving backend resource utilization, improving resiliency in parallel architectures, and ML-based runtime reconfiguration.</p>

                <p>Outside of research, I enjoy teaching and mentoring both undergraduate and graduate students. In the past, I have predominantly taught embedded systems courses to graduate and undergraduate students and my teaching evalutations can be found below. I have also spent significant time mentoring first-year undergraduate ECE students at UT Austin through the First-Year Intergest Group (FIG) program and have continued this work as a graduate student.</p>

                <p> When I am not at UT, I like to read science-fiction and fantasy novels where I am currently working on Don Quixote, The Silmarillion, the slow horses series, and the cosmere. I also enjoy playing soccer, running, hiking, reading, and baking.</p>
