            <p> I am a third year graduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UT Austin. I research lightweight multithreading solutions for memory bound workloads and runtime solutions for memory bound workloads. I am advised by Dr. Andreas Gerstlauer. I also completed my undergraduate education at UT Austin. All project source code and reports can be found in the Research tab, though I cannot promise it is not out of date. In addition to my research, I have spent 7 semesters as a TA for 5 different classes. All the teaching evaluations for those courses can be found in the Teaching tab. </p> 

            <p> Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, hiking, 90's sitcoms, and especially baking. Feel free to contact me at mebarondeau@utexas.edu</p>
